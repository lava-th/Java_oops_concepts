* Abstract method has only declaration but not the implementation
* abstract method can end with the bracket semicolon not curly brackets
* who will provide the implementation of the abstract method the child classes take care the implementation
* If a class contain at least one abstract method then class should be abstract
* If the implementation of a class is not completed or partially completed such type you declare as abstract class
* If class declare as abstract what it means it is partially implemented class.
