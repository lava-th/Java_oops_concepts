        /*An array is the indexed collection of fixed number of homogenous data elements
        * The main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single variable so that readability of the code will be improved
        * Limitations of arrays:
        * 1.Arrays are fixed in size that is ones we create an array there is no choice of increasing or decreasing size based on our requirement due to this to use arrays concept compulsory we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.
        * 2.Array can hold only homogenous data type elements
        * ex:Student[] s=new Student[1000];
        * s[0]=new Student();
        * s[1]=new Customer(); //incompatible types found customer required student
        * we can solve this problem by using object type array
        * Object[] a=new Object[10000];
        * a[0]=new Student();//valid
        * a[0]=new Customer();//valid
        * 3.Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure and Hence radimenet method support is not available for every requirement we have to write the code explicitly which increases complexity of programming
        * TO overcome above problems of arrays we should go for collections concept
        * collections are growable in nature that is based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size
        * collections can hold both homogenous and heterogeneous elements
        * Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure hence for every requirement ready meant support is available Being a programmer we are responsible to use those method and we are not responsible to implement those method.

        * Difference between arrays and collections.
        * 1.Arrays are fixed in size that is once we creates an array we can't increase or decrease based on our requirement
        * 1.collections are growable in nature that is based on requirement we can increase or decrease the size
        * 2.with respect to memory arrays are not recommended to use
        * 2.with respect to memory collection are recommended to use
        * 3.with respect to performance arrays are recommended to use.
        * 3.with respect to performance collections are not recommended to use
        * 4.Arrays can hold only homogenous data type elements
        * 4.collections can hold both homogenous and heterogeneous elements
        * 5.There is no underlying data structure for arrays and hence the readyment method supposed not available for every requirement to write the code explicitly which increases complexity of programming
         5.Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence for every requirement radeyment  method support is available being a programmer we can used this methods directly and we are not responsible to implement those methods
         * 6.Errors can hold both primitives and objects
         * 6.collections can hold only object types but not primitives*/
        /*Collections:If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection
        * Collection framework:It contains several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as single entity
        * Java as collection, collection framework
        * equality terminology in c++ as container,STL(standard template library)
